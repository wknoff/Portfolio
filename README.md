# Portfolio

# Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.
## Projects:
[Three Axis Motor Stage](/Three Axis Motor Stage/index.md)


# At the moment, the only files I have in it are dedicated to research I did at Laboratory for Advanced Integrated Circuits and Systems which is based at the University of Rochester, my college.
# The purpose of these files is to establish a baseline method of controlling a three-axis stepper motor stage for lab photonics experiments. All code is written in C++.
# Although the code functions as purposed, it could be improved by fleshing out more control functions allow for easier control and live console user input.

# I hope you enjoy.
